    <h1>Internet</h1>
    <i>The Internet,</i> sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide 
    system of computer networks -- a network of networks in which users
     at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information
      from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at
       other computers). It was conceived by the <font color="red" face="verdana,tahoma,arial">Advanced Research 
       Projects Agency (ARPA) </font>of the U.S. government in 1969 and was
        first known as the ARPANET. The original aim was to create
         a network that would allow users of a research computer at
          one university to "talk to" research computers at other
           universities.
